### I decided to pursue Software Engineering, because personally I needed a change. I been self employed, owning and operating my mobile detailing business since the age of 17. At 32 years of age i decided to enter into  a new career, where i have no clue or understanding.. and im up to the challenge. I chose software engineering to test my knowldge and understanding of the how's and why's of computer programming. Im a fish out of water but I am confident in my ability to learn and adapt and actually master the art of Software Engineering.
